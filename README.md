# RISC-V_ISA

#### Introduction to RISC-V Basics
##### RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture
This is the way we are going to talk to the computers. If we need a C program to run on computer/ hardware with a particular layout (interior of the chip present inside the laptop). The C program is first compiled into assembly program language which is nothing but the RISC-V assembly language program. This assembly language program is converted into the machine language program in the form of binary language program which is understood by the hardware of the computer present in the hexadecimal format.

We need to implement the RISC-V specification present in C language into some RTL. From RTL to layout is called as the standard PnR flow (RTL to GDS flow). The entire flow starts from the RISC-V architecture. And implemented in RTL and RTL to layout.
